# EnergyMarketSimulator
This project aims to create intelligent energy market simulator to simulate behavior of energy market's actors.
This project is part of my training in Agent-based modeling, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence in energy systems environemnt
for difference circumstance.

As a big picture of this product, I try to create multiple subsections contains:
1- trading engine which capable to matches every bid and ask orders
2- design consumer agents which participate to put bid orders to buy utilities from market
3- design producer agents which participate to put ask orders to sell their utilities
4- desing regulatory agents which regulate the rules of markets based on different circumstances
5- optimization module which aims to optimize the behavior of each agents
